# Image forgery detection by transforming local descriptors into deep-derived features

## Overview
This project is designed for feature extraction from a publicly available dataset and classification using the LIBSVM tool. The code is structured to easily select and extract specific features for further analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system as the provided scripts are in MATLAB format.

### Dataset
This project utilizes three publicly available datasets for training and testing the image forgery detection models:
1. **Korus**: [RGB: 1980x1080x3]. Access it [here](http://kt.agh.edu.pl/korus).
2. **Casia**: [RGB: 384Ã—256X3]. Access it [here](http://forensics.idealtest.org/).
3. **DVMM**: [Grayscale: 128x128]. Access it [here](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/downloads/ AuthSplicedDataSet/dlform.html).

Please download and place these datasets in the  folder within the project directory before proceeding with the feature extraction.


### Extracting Features
1. Navigate to the `features` folder.
2. Open the `main.m` file.
3. You will find seven features commented out. Uncomment the feature you wish to extract. The available features are represented as follows:
   - PRNU
   - Camera Fingerprint
   - LBP
   - Saliency Map
   - Energy 
   - DWT
   - YCbCr

4. Run the `main.m` file. Extracted features will be saved in the specified directory.

### Extracting Deep-Derived Features
For deep-derived features, we utilize a pre-trained VGG16 model:
1. Navigate to the `features` folder.
2. Open the `extracting_CNN_features.m` file.
3. Ensure you have a trained VGG16 model file in your directory.
4. Run the `extracting_CNN_features.m` script to extract features using the VGG16 model.

### Classification
1. Use the file `Do_compute_binary_classification.m` in the `features` folder for classification.
2. Ensure you configure your paths and parameters as needed before running the classification scripts.
